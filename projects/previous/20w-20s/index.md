# Winged 20W-20S #

> In the age of working from home, why can’t we date from home? All the facilities to do so are available to us, but the idea seemed so BIZARRE only a couple of months ago!
> Virtual dating before the lockdowns were initiated due to the Covid-19 pandemic was basically non-existent, dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and etc. all relied on that physical human connection. Even if some tried to incorporate virtual dating into their existing product, it just DIDN’T WORK!! And so, came along…Winged Dating.
