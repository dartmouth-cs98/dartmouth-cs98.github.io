This is your final for the term and a public demo of the projects! Invite your friends, family, enemies, and randos!  There will be food and drinks!

Demos are **Wednesday, March 17th, Online @ 6-8pm**. Please show up at **5:50pm** to get ready and don't leave before your instructor comes by (remember we could have had a final instead!).  The event will be expo style - you will have a *virtual* table with your project name. 

<!-- Come early to clean up your screens and set things up. -->

Be prepared to
* Motivate the idea to a general audience (very brief intros, don't spend too much time talking)
* Show it in action and __let people try it out__!
* Discuss challenges
* Ask for feedback

<!-- ## For 98.02: Your Final DEMO! -->

This is your time to shine.  Show off what you built in all of its glory.  Your product should be public: if it is an app, hopefully it was approved and in your platforms app store, if it is a web app have it hosted on a real domain (register something better than surge or heroku). 

<!-- If you have time, print out some business cards at Gnomon if you want to get users onto your platform. -->

The goal here is to celebrate what you built and share it with the world.  You should be bug free and fully operational.

Your last step is your [final submission](t2-summary.md).

<!-- ## For 98.01: Focus on MPV and TESTING

Demos should be MVP - showcase features that are essential for your project and focus on getting those working. IE, what is the core thing that your project does — you don't need any extra stuff like settings, edge cases, unnecessary fields, etc —  but you do need the main idea to come across and be testable.  If you need help prioritizing, slack me!

Your product needs to be usable by the public.  If it is an app get it on testflight for ios, or unlisted on google play store so people can try it, if a website get it deployed on a public domain. Have some devices on hand so people can demo that way also.

You'll want to be able to observe and keep notes on how people use what you've built - have a form with some questions.  Don't ask general questions like "would you use this?". Ask more specific questions that you want resolved.  Do you prefer a slider or a dropdown?  How would you use this product?  You’ll use this feedback to start the next term so this is important.  Don't forget to collect data.  Also keep good observational notes that are more than,  "it seemed people liked it", and more like, "30% of users attempted clicking button 3 when it wasn't enabled".  Be creepy, watch people interact with your product.

Grades for this term will be "ONGOING" in banner.

To Turn In for 98.01:
* fill out team form
* submit short short super short what went well / what didn't
* summarize your user testing and feedback on a new wiki page on your repo `user testing 18w`- record as much as you can remember. -->
