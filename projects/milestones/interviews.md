## Collect Some Ideas

This milestone is to get our thoughts percolating about ideas that might be from outside our usual experience.  To accomplish this we'll first ask some people who are not students (we'll get to Dartmouth students later). People often have random back-burner ideas or insights into problems — things that they wish had solutions, or ideas for solutions that they wish they knew how to build. Often people are willing to give these away for the price of a ☕️.

## Find Someone

Your mission is to find at least 1 person who is not a student and invite them to a short chat (social distanced, zoom call, etc). This could be a professor you find inspiring, a mentor, a parent, a co-worker from an internship, your favorite barista, or someone completely random in town. If a family member then you have to do 2 interviews as it is generally easier to interview a family member. 

## Interview Them

Tell them you have an annoying prof that wants you to ask around for cool ideas/problems that people have.  Ask them if they've ever wished some product existed, or if they have any "if I quite my job I'd want to invent X" kind of ideas.  Often profs have lots of ideas about random things that if they had time/energy/CS skillz/money they might want to build.  Ask them about what irritates them.  Try for forge a connection with them around irritating and annoying things you hate. Hatred can lead to innovation.

Try to prompt them to **tell some stories about times they were pissed off**, or times they noticed a clever solution to something, or about things in the world that they care deeply about.  Emotions are good, note how they feel towards the problem, do their eyes light up in excitement or anger? 

Pay attention to them while you converse. How are they acting? Are there any particularly strong emotions related to any of the topics? Try to step outside of yourself, **don't worry about what you are going to say, stay focused on them**. Having a partner helps make sure that one of you is able to participate in the conversation and one can be observing / provide addition questions or prompts if needed to keep things smooth.


## Partner

Do this assignment with a partner (but you each need to have chosen 1 person to interview together, so at least 2 interviews together).  It is much easier to keep conversations going with a partner to help.  Have one person take notes. Have some prepared questions / topics.  Talk about some ideas you might have and build off of them. If you can't find a partner - ask in the #section-fallwinter slack channel, if you choose to do this one without a partner then record the conversation so you aren't taking notes while having the conversation. Ask for their permission to do so.

## Tips On Good Need Finding

We won't have time to dive deep into design thinking, but there are many techniques from design thinking and human centered design that would be helpful to us as we expand our problem scope. 

As you interview, try to follow the process in the [d.school's empathy fieldguide](img/empathy.pdf). Before you can solve a problem, or even correctly identify it, you need to be able to empathize with the person you are interviewing or observing.  No need to make an empathy map, but do check out the anatomy of an interview section.

## Record

Compile your notes in a [github gist](https://gist.github.com) (name it with a `.md` extension). Try to collect at least a couple stories / ideas / problems. 

Here is a markdown template that you can copy into your gist to get you started:

# Need Finding Interviews


## Interview 1:
* name:
* date:
* occupation:
* relationship to interviewers:
* location:
* interview partner:

### Some potential questions to get you started

* What does your day to day life look like?
* What are the hardest parts of your day? In general/long term?
* If you had a lot of skills and money, what would you make or do?
* What is a time that you were pissed off at something?
* What is a time you noticed a clever solution to something?
* What are some things you like?
* What do you dislike? 
* Products that you wished existed?
* Could you tell me story about a time you ______?
* What was your best/worst/craziest/most memorable experience with (area of focus)?
* What would I find surprising about . . .?

### Record Any Observations

* What were they doing while you asked them stuff?
* Any particular reactions / emotions during the interview or specific questions?

### Reflect / Conclusions

* were there any problems or stories that made you think, "how might we help __ do __?"
* what are some HMW statements you can draw from this conversation?
* for your favorite:
  * who is the target audience?
  * what would the problem statement be?
  * what would a potential solution be?
```

Try to draw some conclusions at the end.  In particular think about the stories you heard and try to come up with some How Might We (HMW) questions. [Here's another d.school bit about HMW's](img/how-might-we.pdf).

## To Turn In

* gist url

## In Class

* be prepared to share the stories in class
