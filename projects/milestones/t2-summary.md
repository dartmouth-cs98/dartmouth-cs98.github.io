Demos are now done!  Hopefully, everything worked perfectly.  Just a couple of last things to do.  

## README's
Make sure all your readme's are updated and that getting the project up and running for testing is possible based on your documentation.  

## Report
Submit a debrief of the term and your team survey.  We want to get a sense of how things went for you.  Highlight successes and challenges, talk about your validation steps and success metrics. And finally discuss some takeaways. Did you achieve what you set out to?

Put this in a wiki page `Final Project Report` that looks like the following: 

```markdown
# Final Project Report 

## Summary/Debrief 
*what went well and what didn't*

## Validation 
*take a look back on your proposed validation, how did validation go?  talk about any success metrics achieved and the challenges of those not*

## Potential Next Steps
*if you were to continue what would be next?*

## Final Takeaways
*talk about any lessons learned, what could have been done differently, hopes for the future, what you really enjoyed*

```

## Gifs
Create several gifs of your product in action. These can be short - show some cool part of your product working. This will be displayed for posterity to inspire the next generation, so make them inspirational!

There are lots of gif making apps out there: [gif brewery](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery), [giphycapture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture), [screentogif](http://www.screentogif.com/)

Add these to your project wiki homepage, or to a `In Action` wiki page.
