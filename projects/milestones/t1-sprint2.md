## Overview 

This is the time to transition to the next sprint!  This will involve a short review and team retrospective and planning next steps. 

You should have an in-person team meeting and resolve all your currently working on tasks as best you can in preparation for this meeting.  All your previous sprint assigned issues and feature pull requests should be reviewed and merged into master so you can demo your work.


### Review

During the meeting you should each demo your week's work to your team. It is nice to use this moment to celebrate accomplishments, clap loudly for your teammates and support each other.

This is a good time to get immediate feedback as well â€” so try the features out and if there are bugs, put them in ZenHub!

## Retrospective 

Have a time to discuss what is working and what isn't.  Include a summary of this when you submit this!

ðŸš€ Add to your Sprint Retrospectives Wiki Page

Here's a template:

```markdown
* Retrospective on Sprint #_: 
    * members in attendance:
        ![selfie proof of meeting]()
        - [x] Jasmine
        - [ ] Alladin
    * what worked well
        * we made progress
        * etc
    * what didn't
        * we didn't make much progress
        * etc
    * self assessment on progress
        * where are you in relation to progress towards finalfinal product? 
          * give an estimate of how far towards your goals you are, do you think you're on track? 
        * lay out *each* of the following weeks till end of term with brief goals for each
          * current week: goals
          * week #: goals
          * week #: goals, etc
```

You'll update this weekly during your sprint transitions! 


## Your Mission for Sprint 3

Start prioritizing functionality that you need tested during end of term demos.  This term we're working towards a functional and **testable** MVP for demos, so you should be starting to think about what is core functionality that will make for a compelling demo of your idea.  Work towards that!

Remember, prioritize hard/real functionality over filler. Don't worry about things like *settings pages*, rather focus the core functionality. 


## Planning / Rake Your ZenHub Garden

Now plan out your next steps.  Add in *Unsorted* new issues, sort them into *Later* and *Next*.  Assign at least 4 issues per person.

During this step you should follow the [Rake Your ZenHub Garden](wiring-start-sprint#rake-your-zenhub-garden) steps. You'll do this every week.
