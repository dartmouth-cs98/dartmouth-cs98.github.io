## To Start

_You may work with up to 1 other person on this - but you are welcome to also work individually._


ðŸš€ setup and clone a github repo using github classroom here: [https://classroom.github.com/g/spgQ3doa](https://classroom.github.com/g/spgQ3doa). If working in a group, the first person to accept the invite via the link above should name the repo, the "team" in GitHub Classroom. The second person should still use the same link above but then select the name of the team already created.  GitHub Classroom will then generate a repository for you from a template that includes a README.md file to fill out. 

ðŸš€ Clone this repository and then do all your hack-a-thing work in the repository.  To submit your hack-a-thing simply commit and push, and then submit the link to the repo on Canvas. 


## Overview
To get ready to build your project and to stretch our coding muscles this milestone will be a little bit different from the others.  We're going to spend a week to hack together using some technology you are interested in learning.  What you build could be related to project ideas you already have but don't be too tied to it as things could change.  Consider this an opportunity to play with some of the technologies that you are potentially considering using. If you might want to build a webapp that uses video or an ios app that uses accelerometer, etc, build a small test of that technology.  You are welcome to use this time to try your hand at coding in a framework related to your project, for instance React if you want to build a webapp, or Unity3D if you want to play with game stuff, etc.  If you've never coded in a particular technology now would be the time to try it out before you start working on a full project without feeling like you have to commit.

## Time Commitment/complexity

You should plan to spend **at least 10 hours** on this. The workload of this course overall is at a minimum 10 hours a week â€” if you spend less your final product may suffer and you will make the world sad.

## Team

You may work with up to 1 other person on this. This can be an opportunity to try to work with someone new or try out a working dynamic with someone you might want to work with later.

## Build

Choose some technology and build a thing.  This can be as simple as finding a good tutorial or 2 or 3 and following them, or get your hands dirty with a problem that is related to your project and try to see if you can get it working.  For instance, if you think you want to build a webapp where image uploading will be an integral part, you could get a standalone feature up that has image uploading.  Or if you think your product will be an iOS app but you've never coded one, you could follow an online tutorial to get a sample iOS app up and running. The goal is to have a bit of time to play with some technologies and gain a bit of comfort with the potential options that you are considering for your project.

## Scope

Do not use a personal project you have worked on in the past - this needs to be something new that you have wanted to explore but have not had the chance to. It should be approximately 10hrs work of effort, so if you do a tutorial and you're done with it in 2 hours, try expanding it or do multiple tutorials.

## Tutorials

Remember to acknowledge any tutorials or resources you used in your [README.md](#readme) file. There are many good tutorials out there - popular choices are react-native, Unity3D, voice technologies, AR/VR, etc.   http://lynda.dartmouth.edu/ is a decent source for some.

## README

All your projects on github should include a README.md file.  For this milestone all it needs is:

* Short description of what you attempted to build
* Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
* What you learned
* What didn't work

## GitHub

This is also a time to figure out how to use git flow - if you are working with someone else.  On your final project you'll be required to use git flow with feature branch style [pull requests](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/).   

ðŸš€ You should make sure you have github set up with your [correct github email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/) so that your commits are recognized as belonging to you.  Make sure you have at least 2 commits connected to your github email on this.  Points taken off if this is not so.

ðŸ›‘ The above is critical. If you do not have your author email set correctly / not registered with github then your commit history becomes an untrackable mess and we will deduct points over and over until you fix it.

## To Turn In

* github url to your repo for your attempt
* README.md file included in repo per above
* at least 2 commits per person with [author recognized by github](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/#commits-are-not-linked-to-any-user).

## In Class

* be prepared to show a demo/screenshots of what you built in class / talk about what you learned.
