## Overview

Goal: Hack on something potentially related to your project

Similarly to [Hack-A-Thing-1](hack-a-thing-1), we'll spend a week hacking on some technology. However, now you can either choose a new technology to try out that is more relevant to your project, or you can go deeper on what you were working on previously.  However, if you choose to dive deeper there is an expectation that the work is reasonably complex to justify two weeks of experimentation. Don't just brush this assignment off and follow some easy tutorial.  This is a chance to play around with something you've been curious about and share it with the rest of the class.  If you choose to keep hacking on the same thing as last week make sure to use git tag to mark it, and that you do enough on it to count. 

If you already have a team and an idea — you should attempt to hack on something related to your idea.  Use this as an opportunity to brush up on needed skills, or to hack a small technology demo of some particular functionality.   Don't worry about merging it in later, these are standalone hacks, but they'll help you figure out how to do it better once you are implementing it for realz later.

## Using git tags

```bash
git commit #make sure you are all committed and pushed
git tag hack-a-thing-1 #this will tag the current place you are at as hack-a-thing-1
git push origin --tags
```

## Time Commitment/complexity

You should plan to spend at least 10 hours on this. The workload of this course overall is at a minimum 10 hours a week — if you spend less your final product may suffer and you will make the world sad.

## Teams

For this milestone you should work in pairs. This is also an opportunity to try to work with someone new or try out a working dynamic.

## Build

Choose some technology and build a thing.  This can be as simple as finding a good tutorial and following it or get your hands dirty with a problem that is related to your project and try to see if you can get it working.  For instance, you think you want to build a webapp where image uploading will be an integral part. For this you could get a standalone page up that has image uploading.  Or if you think your product will be an iOS app but you've never coded one, for this you could follow an online tutorial to get a sample iOS app up and running.  The goal is to have a bit of time to play with some technologies and gain a bit of comfort with the potential options that you are considering for your project.

## Tutorials

If you follow a tutorial or two just remember to acknowledge this fact in your README file.

## To Start

* setup and clone a github repo using github classroom here: [https://classroom.github.com/g/hyGnTHEh](https://classroom.github.com/g/hyGnTHEh)
* first person in your group to click the link above will provision the repo and name it
* second person in your group should just click the link above also and select the proper group to be added to it

## README

All your projects on github should include a README.md file.  For this milestone all it needs is:

* Short description of what you attempted to build
* Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
* What you learned
* How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
* What didn't work

## GitHub

This is also a time to figure out how to use git flow.  On your final project you'll be required to use git flow with feature branch style [pull requests](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/).   You should make sure you have github set up with your [correct github email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/) so that your commits are recognized as belonging to you.  Make sure you have at least 1 commit connected to your github email on this.


## To Turn In

* github url to your repo for your attempt
* readme.md file included in repo per above
* at least 2 commits per person with [author recognized by github](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/#commits-are-not-linked-to-any-user).

## In Class

* be prepared to show a demo of what you built in class!
