## Overview

Goal: Hack on something potentially related to your project

Similarly to [Hack-A-Thing-1](hack-a-thing-1), we'll spend a week hacking on some technology. However, now you can try out something that is more relevant to your project together with some of your teammates.

You should attempt to hack on something related to your teams project idea.  Use this as an opportunity to brush up on needed skills, or to hack a small technology demo of some particular functionality.  Don't worry about merging it in later, these are standalone hacks, but they'll help you figure out how to do it better once you are implementing it for realz later.

*If your first hack-a-thing is something related to your project, you can choose to dive deeper on it with the expectation that your second hack-a-thing is reasonably complex to justify two weeks of experimentation.*

## Time Commitment/complexity

You should plan to spend at least 10 hours on this.

## Teams

For this milestone you can work in pairs from your project team. Discuss as a team what sorts of things you want to try out. This is a chance for team members to learn the stack and to explore some code libraries.

## Build

Choose some technology and build a thing.  This can be as simple as finding a good tutorial and following it or get your hands dirty with a problem that is related to your project and try to see if you can get it working.  For instance, you think you want to build a webapp where image uploading will be an integral part. For this you could get a standalone page up that has image uploading.  Or if you think your product will be an iOS app but you've never coded one, for this you could follow an online tutorial to get a sample iOS app up and running.

## Tutorials

If you follow a tutorial or two just remember to acknowledge this fact in your README file.

## To Start

ðŸš€ setup and clone a github repo using github classroom here: [https://classroom.github.com/g/rM_zQP7v](https://classroom.github.com/g/rM_zQP7v). If working in a group, the first person to accept the invite via the link above should name the repo, the "team" in GitHub Classroom. The second person should still use the same link above but then select the name of the team already created.  GitHub Classroom will then generate a repository for you from a template that includes a README.md file to fill out. 

ðŸš€ Clone this repository and then do all your hack-a-thing work in the repository.  To submit your hack-a-thing simply commit and push, and then submit the link to the repo on Canvas. 

## README

All your projects on github should include a README.md file.  For this milestone all it needs is:

* Short description of what you attempted to build
* Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
* What you learned
* How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
* What didn't work

## GitHub

This is also a time to figure out how to use git flow.  On your final project you'll be required to use git flow with feature branch style [pull requests](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/).   You should make sure you have github set up with your [correct github email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/) so that your commits are recognized as belonging to you.  Make sure you have at least 1 commit connected to your github email on this.


## To Turn In

* github url to your repo for your attempt
* readme.md file included in repo per above
* at least 2 commits per person with [author recognized by github](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/#commits-are-not-linked-to-any-user).

## In Class

* be prepared to show a demo of what you built in class!
