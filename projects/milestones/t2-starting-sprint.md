title: Sprint 1 Planning
published: true
---



This is the time to make some plans for this term. We will do fewer pre-assigned milestones but will instead focus on custom milestones for your individual projects.

As you think about your milestones, consider any feedback you collected and carefully prioritize your features. You have 9 weeks to turn your current beta MVP into a polished, fully working, and shipped final product!  Think about your critical features and accommodate them first.  Make sure your user flow works and makes sense. 

As you think ahead, you should know that this term is fast paced. You should have v2 ready for beta release by midterms. For any consumer facing product you'll want to get it into the hands of real users by week 7 or so. That last step is hard, polishing a thing and shipping it, you think you can save it for last, but don't be that group that is pulling an all-nighter before final demos. 


## ZenHub Refresher!

<br>*(release velocity planning in ZenHub)*

Remember our pal ZenHub?  We're mostly just going to keep doing sprints all term! Similar but slightly different.

## New Term - New Issues

1. 🚀Go through **ALL** your current *New Issues* and deal with them.
    * Either sort them into *Icebox* if you aren't going to work on them soon.
    * *Backlog* if they are something to work on next.
    * *InProgress* for the specific tasks you are currently going to work on.
    * Close issues that are old or deprecated. 
1. 🚀Enter in **ALL** bugs from the past term.
    * create new issues (select the appropriate repo "Create in ..." if associated with a particular repo).
    * label them with a <span style="color: red;">🐛bug</span> label
    * you can break them down further with:
        * <font style="color:red">[ 🔥 blocker]</font>
        * <font style="color:orange">[ ❗️important]</font>
        * <font style="color:lightblue">[ 🍲 back burner]</font>
        * <font style="color:grey">[ 🙅won't fix]</font>
1. 🚀Enter in **ALL** new feature ideas
    * create new issues (select the appropriate repo "Create in ..." if associated with a particular repo) for each new feature idea you had via feedback last term, or as you brainstormed earlier in this milestone.
    * label them with a <span style="color: blue;"> 💎enhancement</span> tag or <span style="color: orange;">🚔critical</span> or others as you see fit. Feel free to use `invalid` and/or create your own tags.
    * if any seem to be epics feel free to upgrade them now also - certainly anything that is a full feature.
1. 🚀Create a milestone:
    * create a new milestone and label it `term2 week1 sprint` with a due date of `03/31/2019`. **always add due dates to sprints**
    * assign some tasks, the usual 4 per. 

## Scope and Assignment

Remember that each issue/task should be scoped to be around 1 sitdown work session, just a couple hours. Break up large tasks into individual smaller ones, each one should be under a few hours of work. The smaller the tasks the actually faster you will work (not just the appearance of speed).  It is easier to take on a manageable scope issue and work through it than if the issue has multiple steps that quickly become overwhelming to think through.

💢Feel free to assign each other tasks, a little aggressiveness is ok! you can interact via comments on the issues also, on a good project the board will feel like a community, people upvoting and clapping for each other, discussing the issues, or how best to implement something. EC: mention `@timofei7` or `@ksalesin` in an issue or a PR when you need help or feedback or want to say hi. We're happy to help — and since this was a wall of text we'll know that you happened to read it all. 

## Monday Checkins

Every Monday, after your sprint transition, we'll do a checkin in class specific to what you what you worked on. You should be prepared to show progress and we're review your transition and help scope out next steps if you need.

## To Turn In:
* do all the steps and get your zenhub boards in order.
* submit zenhub link to your workspace with a filter set
* work on and close some issues. Let's front load this term and get a lot done in the next couple of weeks.
