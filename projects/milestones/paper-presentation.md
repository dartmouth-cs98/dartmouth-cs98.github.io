## Overview

To do a bit more research into cool ideas and technologies, we will find and share a cool article or tech paper. The format will be a __quick__ (max 1 min) summary about what you found / why it might be interesting to explore further in the context of the class!

These could be about an interesting use of technoglogy such as [hearables](https://www.fastcompany.com/90212065/the-future-is-ear-why-hearables-are-finally-techs-next-big-thing), or a technical paper such as [Project Zanzibar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-zanzibar/#!publications). 

It could be something inspiring such as [this adobe sketch/animate product](https://www.sketchbook.com/blog/motion-new-app-sketchbook-pro-members/).

It could be weird like [this best of CHI 2018 paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3173574.3173784).

You don't need to be as theatrical as the [SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/) Paper Fast Forward, but beat this if you can:
