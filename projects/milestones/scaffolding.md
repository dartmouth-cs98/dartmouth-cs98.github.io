This milestone is all about setting up some initial code scaffolding.

## Scaffolding

Now that you have your functionality mapped out let’s start on planning the coding. You now have the features all planned out. How do you want to build it? Plan out what technology you think you want to use and let’s get some code scaffolding ready. The project does have some minimal technical complexity that must be satisfied, but you are free to choose whatever tech stacks you wish.

You should get some basics of your project up and running.  If your project as a UI try to do a little layout so that you have a main component and a hello world for the frontend and a hello world from the backend. If you have an idea of any modules and libraries you are planning on using, document them and or get them installed in your repos. At this point you should have your project code started and ready to work on.  The frameworks should be set up and running and a local development environment set up for everybody on the team.

## Readme

In your project’s main README.md file (you may have multiple repos, but for now just use the repo you’ll be using for whatever is ending up being the frontend) start to outline the tech stack you will using. As you work on the project your README.md file will be a record of the tools you are using and how to get your dev environment running.

Start this doc now:
```

# Project Name

TODO: super short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups

## Architecture

TODO:  overall descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

## Setup

TODO: how to get the project dev environment up and running, npm install etc, all necessary commands needed, environment variables etc

## Deployment

TODO: how to deploy the project

## Authors

TODO: list of authors

## Acknowledgments
```

You don’t have to fill in the whole document for this milestone, but do start on it and fill in what you can. This README is for now the defacto "landing page" for your project. It should be kept up-to-date so that I / anybody can clone your repos and run your project dev environment.  This needs to be updated — this is how I will know how to set up your project to test and how your teammates will know how to get it running as well.

Note: using github will be an essential part of how you will work together.  You are required to use git flow — i.e. use branches and pull requests as you work together. You don’t necessarily need to do code reviews, but doing git flow with feature branches will help you organize your team and your code.

## To Turn In:
* GitHub URL to your repo on canvas (for grading ease)
* Code scaffolding:
  * some initial starter code
  * working hello worlds for any server/frontend/etc platforms
  * github repos set up with README.md files started
  * demonstrated use by every team member of git branches -> pull requests
