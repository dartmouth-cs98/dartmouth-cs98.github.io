At this point you should have a version of your product ready for a private beta release!  We will dogfood our own products at this point. The term dogfooding comes from "eating your own dogfood" an industry term for using your own products.  Some people prefer to call this "drinking your own champagne" or "icecreaming" (developing icecream that you would want to eat yourself).

During class we will pair up teams to setup testing of each other's products.  In preparation, your product should work!

## Testing Plan

Also, you should think about a plan for testing.  Are there any assumptions about your product that you might want to test?   Take careful observational notes.  Come up with a set of questions to ask each tester: one set for after their first pass at using your product and then also in a few days after they have had some time with it.  Avoid asking questions like: "did you enjoy our product / find it useful".  These types of questions often suffer from various [response biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias).  Survey subjects often suffer from acquiescence bias and try to give you the answer they think you want. So the trick is to construct questions that are balanced and ask for specifics.

Likert scale questions are often used in surveys (usually these are 5 point scales from strongly disagree to agree).  Sometimes you can avoid the middle undecided value and force subjects to either agree or disagree which can be helpful if your subjects are timid. Good Likert questions might look like:  "I prefer functionality X over Y", "Would feature X improve the product", "logging in is important for this app".  Try to avoid leading questions and have a mix of questions where some you can evaluate numerically and some free form comments.

The goal is to inform your further development.  At this point you don't need to know if people like your app or not, but you do want to know if there are concrete ways to improve it.

## Flip Side

You should spend some decent time helping out the other team in testing.  Each team will do a peer evaluation of their partnered team -- your feedback is critical and you'll get points for it: Peer Feedback



Analysis
Once you've collected and given feedback it is time to analyze your results.  Sort through any survey results and observation notes.  Identify top patterns and write them up.  What should your next steps be?  Try to prioritize your milestones based on your testing.  Add at least 4 new milestones to your github!



To Turn In:

Your testing plan - what questions were you asking, how did you plan to do your observations?
Feedback and analysis of results. Submit a document that includes thoughts about how the testing went and your new priorities (1 pager is ok).  Don't sugar coat. This isn't about how far the project has progressed, but about how the testing went - report accurately and make plans accordingly!  Add at least 4 new milestones to your github.
