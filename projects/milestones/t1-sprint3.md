## Overview 

This is the time to transition to the next sprint!  This will involve a short review and team retrospective and planning next steps. 

You should have an in-person team meeting and resolve all your currently working on tasks as best you can in preparation for this meeting.  All your previous sprint assigned issues and feature pull requests should be reviewed and merged into master so you can demo your work.


### Review

During the meeting you should each demo your week's work to your team. It is nice to use this moment to celebrate accomplishments, clap loudly for your teammates and support each other.

This is a good time to get immediate feedback as well — so try the features out and if there are bugs, put them in ZenHub!

## Retrospective 

Have a time to discuss what is working and what isn't.  Include a summary of this when you submit this!

🚀 Create a wiki page:  Sprint Retrospectives

Here's a template:

```markdown
* Retrospective on Sprint #_: 
    * members in attendance:
        ![selfie proof of meeting]()
        - [x] Jasmine
        - [ ] Alladin
    * what worked well
        * we made progress
        * etc
    * what didn't
        * we didn't make much progress
        * etc
    * self assessment on progress
        * where are you in relation to progress towards finalfinal product? 
          * give an estimate of how far towards your goals you are, do you think you're on track? 
        * lay out *each* of the following weeks till end of term with brief goals for each
          * current week: goals
          * week #: goals
          * week #: goals, etc
```

You'll update this weekly during your sprint transitions! 


## Your Mission for Sprint 4

At this point, you should basically be all set for demos!  

Kidding, but seriously, this week you come up with a plan for what your demo will look like and work towards making sure you can execute it. You should plan on having a fully testable prototype by the end of this sprint!


## Planning / Rake Your ZenHub Garden

Now plan out your next steps.  Add in *New Issues*, sort them into *IceBox* and *Backlog*.  Assign at least 4 issues per person.

During this step you should follow the [Rake Your ZenHub Garden](wiring-start-sprint#rake-your-zenhub-garden) steps. You'll do this every week.
