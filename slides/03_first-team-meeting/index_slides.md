???
* teams have been formed - lots of complex spreadsheets
* couple of comments:
* don't be sad if your idea didn't get enough votes to qualify - you got it out there and still have an opportunity to change the minds of your teammates - this is just a starter
* short window during which we can shuffle around teams - arrange your own swaps or talk to me if you want to move.  most teams of 4 or 5 but we could do up to 6 and in special cases down to 3 - talk to me if that is the case
* this part is always challenging and we tried to take into account your project preference first - then people preferences - and i even read through your 'what i want to get out of this class responses from the registration form"
* if your team has an asterisk - come talk to me after this
* next year i think i'll gather feedback on peoples choices to be able to give back
