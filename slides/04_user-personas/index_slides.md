* purpose is to get to know the produce from a users perspective - what do people want from it
* often teams have important realizations
* things like limitations of the target audience, children who can't read yet,  the value props for the various stakeholders, what is in it for them, what reward systems can you put in place to get higher engagement?
* stakeholders could include: investors, founders, end users, admins, the scientific community
* there are always stakeholders - people who would care about what you are building

* 1 persona per team member

???
* create 1 persona per person on your team - then assign yourselves to one
