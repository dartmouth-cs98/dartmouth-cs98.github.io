???
* i know there's a lot of text in the milestone... but its not rocket science - you just have to maintain a current sprint and issues that are sorted
* as the week goes you can add issues into the new issues pile and wait until the retrospective to sort them out
* each subtask is one code session or thereabouts
* using milestones will give you a way to group your weekly tasks even when the are just parts of epics - remember epics are for long feature - milestones group tasks by week - so you can see the progress you are making
