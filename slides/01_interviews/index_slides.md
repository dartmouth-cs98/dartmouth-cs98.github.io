* notion for class
* share hackathings
* discuss interviews

???
* first question - how many people would like to have a second freeform hackathing for next week  - or should we do project idea pitches starting next week
* looks like starting pitches next week!  will post how to create pitch slides
* for notion - let's use this to supplement any sharing in class - so we'll post activities in here
* also make yourself exist in the class directory - even if you think you have your team all set, still good to get to know some of your classmates - we'll use that database in the projects database as well.
* might just port the entire class website over to notion for simplicity.

name: Deeper Take

.fancy.medium[![](img/no-idea.gif)]

* Discuss the chosen idea as a team
* Hear from everybody to identify:
  * **platform** (vr, product, mobile, web, text, etc)
  * **topic/problem statement** (hmw from interviews)
  * **audience** (4 year olds with missing teeth, single parents, stressed teens, mail delivery people in their 70s)


???
* oh god not another activity!
* platform like Vr
* topics: like healthcare, problem
* audience: like kindergartners, or  stressed  parents, etc


<!-- 
name: Mix em up

.fancy.medium[![](img/mix-up.gif)]

* 10 MIN:
  * choose 2 sets of 4
  * brainstorm on how to solve the set
* 10 MIN:
  * then as table discuss options and consolidate on 1 idea

???
* idea here is to just insert a bit of randomness, stochastic hill climbing - just in case one of these ideas can be improved a bit with some lateral thinking.
