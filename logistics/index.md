## Slack ##

We will use [Slack](https://cs98-dartmouth.slack.com), an online collaborative tool for most class messaging and help. Details in class. We will also write slack integrations!


## Instructor Meetings ##

Groups will meet with the course instructor weekly in class to discuss progress and plan next steps. Ask questions, be proactive, we're here to help! You are also welcome to [Schedule individual/additional group meeting times here](https://calendly.com/timofei/check-in).


## Grading ##

Grading of collaborative team based work will be done based on GitHub pull requests.  Proper git flow will be introduced early on in the term. Using version control will become second nature to you.

The final grade will be based on a combination of weekly performance, class demos throughout the term, preset milestones, and peer evaluation. Grading will take into account GitHub pull requests. Proper git flow will be introduced early on in the term and will be required for all groups. Since projects are a team effort, you will earn a group grade along with a modifier for individual performance. In extreme cases individuals may be dropped or raised several letter grades from the group.  For instance, if you were the star performer on the team and committed the large majority of code but your teammates didn't pull their weight so the project wasn't quite up to standards: the team might receive a B- but you might get an A.  Alternatively if you slacked and contributed only a few lines to some documentation to boost your git commit count, we will notice and you might get a D even if your teammates pulled off an impressive project without you and the team received an A- overall.  We will read your code and we will have regular code reviews.

* Project Milestones — 50%
    * milestone weights will vary
* Weekly Progress: Instructor Checkins — 35%
* Late penalty: -12% of milestone per day.
* Attendance/Participation: 15%
    * 2 free absences are allowed (no need to ask in advance).



## Honor principle -- Not your standard warning! ##

We want you to be able to show your work and to be proud of the code you have written.  To this end, all your work will be on GitHub.  However, you do need to learn and as such all the code will need to actually be written by you.  Violations will be reported to the Committee on Standards. Regardless of the outcome of the COS hearing, we reserve the right to assign a failing grade on an assignment were we suspect an honor code violation occurred.

### The Internet

The Internet will be a large source of information and help to you as you work on your project.  We want to encourage you to scour the internet / [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for help, **but** you **must credit** any solutions you find in comments in your code specifying where you found them and what you took from them.  If you copy/paste code without attribution you are violating the Academic Honor Principle, and we hope you enjoy your 3 term vacation.  You will **not** be penalized for copied code as long as it is **properly attributed** and some significant portion of your project was still written by you. Obviously don't copy/paste the whole project.

Remember: Just cite it!


### Citation Format

Make your in-code citations look something like this:

```
// adapted from: http://stackoverflow.com/someurl
// this method does x and y

or

// copied off of Cameron Howe's code for this assignment
// this method does x and y
```

(policy adapted from: https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code)


## Consecutive Terms

Since 98.01 and 98.02 involve team projects and the project from 98.01 continues into 98.02, these two courses must be taken in consecutive terms. If a student is not able to do 98.02 in the term immediately after their 98.01, the department asks that the student repeat 98.01 and then take 98.02. In extenuating circumstances, the student can petition the department for an exception. The petition should be addressed to Undergraduate Adviser listed on [this page](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/advice) and should clearly describe why the student believes they deserve an exception.

The Undergraduate Adviser will share the petition with a department faculty committee that will make the final determination.

## Special accommodations and Religious observances ##

Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible.  Similarly for Religious observances please talk to the staff as early as possible to resolve any conflicts.

## Wellness

We recognize that the academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, that our terms are intensive, and that classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including: your [undergraduate dean](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~upperde/), [Counseling and Human Development](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chd/), and the [Student Wellness Center](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~healthed/). I encourage you to use these resources and come speak with me to take care of yourself throughout the term.


## Auditing ##

Unfortunately due to the nature of the class auditing is not possible.

# COVID-19 Addendum

While the COVID-19 pandemic has already changed how this course is structured, it has the potential to result in further personal impact which may prevent you from continuing engagement in the class. This may be due to contraction of the disease by you or a loved one, increased familial responsibilities, financial difficulties, or impacts on your mental/emotional health.

We have structured the course so that these disruptions will not necessarily prevent you from successfully completing this course. Course meetings will be conducted via Zoom with any important messaging recorded. This will enable flexible viewing of the course content. We will schedule opportunities for live interaction with the Professor during diverse times throughout the week. The group project is designed to be facilitate remote work using industry standard collaboration tools.

In the event that you are directly or indirectly impacted by COVID-19 in such a way that will affect your performance in the course, it is imperative that you reach out to the instructor as soon as possible.  You may also reach out to your undergraduate Dean if that would make you more comfortable. We cannot assist you if we don’t know there is a problem. Our first priority is your health and security. We will work to put you in touch with appropriate resources to assist you. In addition, appropriate accommodations (for example: deadline extensions and/or extra office hours) will be implemented.
